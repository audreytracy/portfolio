                        <div>
                            This is an ongoing project! Since this is a personal project & development happens when I'm not otherwise occupied with work or school, it takes a while to add features.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            The ultimate goal of this project is to make a smart sprinkler system that can change its behavior based on the weather forecast. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            Right now the baseline functionality of the existing hardware sprinkler control system is being implemented.

                        <h3>System Design</h3>
                        <div>
                           Take a look at my system specification document for a set of requirements, design diagrams, & release benchmarks.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            To avoid having an open internet-facing device on a home network (which could introduce security risks), a cloud database tracks the sprinkler system & the Raspberry Pi simply reads from this database

                            The user either logs in or creates an account with their email. This creates a UID for the
                            user in Firebase Auth, which is used to reference the user
                            for all other applications of the system.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            The user can view their zones on their dashboard. If the user is logging in for the first
                            time they will be directed to connect their Raspberry Pi. This only happens once.

                        <div>
                            If the user has just logged in for the first time and has not registered their Raspberry Pi
                            they will be prompted to enter the Pi's IP address. Note this is the only time both devices
                            <strong>must be connected to the same network.</strong>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            The user will be promped to log in. Once the device is registered, the user's UID is stored
                            on the Pi and the user can see their sprinkler zones on their dashboard.

                            to demo the GPIO signals.
